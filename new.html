  <p style= "font-size: 25px;"> Trend Alert: The “Cloud Skin” Look ☁️✨

Move over, glass skin — Cloud Skin is the dreamy new makeup trend that’s taking over your feed. Think soft, blurred, velvety textures with a natural matte finish that still looks radiant and alive. It’s all about balance: not too matte, not too dewy — just a soft-focus glow that looks effortlessly filtered in real life.

💭 What is Cloud Skin?
Coined by top makeup artists and seen all over runway looks and beauty TikTok, Cloud Skin focuses on diffused edges, satin-matte finishes, and a pillowy complexion that looks lit-from-within — without the shine.

✨ How to get the look:

Prep smart: Start with a hydrating-but-mattifying primer to control shine but keep skin plump.

Light base: Use a soft matte or serum foundation and blend with a damp sponge for an airbrushed feel.

Blush & bronze softly: Stick to cream or mousse textures for cheeks — think soft peach or rose tones.

No harsh lines: Everything should look like it was blended with clouds — use light layers and buff out edges.

Finish with a mist: A blur-setting spray or light hydrating mist keeps things fresh, not flat.

🧁 Bonus tip: Pair the look with fluffy brows, tinted lip oils, and soft pastel lids for that angelic, Pinterest-worthy vibe.
